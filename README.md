# TherapyManagementProject
Repository for a faux project using Angular and .NET API.

Background: I started this project about a week ago, for my sister. She's a therapist and has already not-so-advanced system, made in Access. I never liked Access that much and I don't understand it enough that I can edit myself to because what this mockup is already.
This is already stable enough for daily use and since it's open source, you may edit what you want and be happy. Please, just tell your therapist that you "stole" it lol.
I also made this to show my .NET/Angular skills. Yeah, they aren't pretty deep but I only learned Angular around September/October and had to complement this using Google/etc, etc..., so it's a good start.
